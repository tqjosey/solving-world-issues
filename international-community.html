											<h3>How The International Community Has Attempted To Resolve The Issue Of Landmines</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											The United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) seeks to guarantee an efficient, proactive and timely response to landmines and explosive remnants of war within the UN system. Its mandate stems from a set of resolutions of the General Assembly on mine action and is assessed by the 4th Committee.
										</p>
										<p>
											Mine action is a combination of humanitarian aid and development studies aimed at reducing the social, economic and environmental impacts of landmines and explosive remnants of war. Mine action enables peacekeepers to send out patrols, humanitarian organizations to provide help, and ordinary people to live without the fear that a misstep might cost them their life. Mine action involves more than removing landmines from the ground. It involves high-impact efforts directed at defending people from danger, helping victims become self-sufficient and active members of their communities, and delivering opportunities for stabilization and viable growth.
										</p>
										<p>
											People die or lose limbs every day as a result of stepping onto a landmine — mostly in peaceful countries — and the majority of victims are civilians. This issue is further addressed by the Anti-personnel Landmine Convention, or the Ottawa Treaty. It prohibits the storage, transfer and use of anti-personnel landmines, and requests nations to clear them on their land, while prescribing states in a position to do so to help impacted nations. Unfortunately, more than 35 countries have not signed the Ottawa Treaty, including some of the world’s largest manufacturers of mines, such as the United States, China, and Russia. 
										</p>
										<p>
										Finally, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) monitors the worldwide progress of mine clearing efforts. Non-governmental organizations such as the Mines Advisory Group and the HALO Trust carry out mine clearing operations, as well as businesses such as BACTEC, a group of companies specializing in landmine clearance and battle area clearance. Canadians also set up the Canadian Landmine Foundation, which carried out 91 initiatives in 13 nations from 1999 to 2008, trained a number of mine detection dogs and raised $4 million in funding. In 2014, the countries that were signatories to the Ottawa Treaty set themselves the goal of completely eradicating landmines by 2025.

											<h2>How NGOs Use Rats To Detect Landmines</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											APOPO, a registered Belgian non-governmental organisation, trains Gambian pouched rats to detect landmines with their highly developed sense of smell. Currently studies are being conducted in various countries about the best ways to train these rats, and determine their abilities and limits to detecting mines.
