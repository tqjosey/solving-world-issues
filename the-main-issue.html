											<h2>The Main Issue</h2>
											<h3>Why Landmines Are Still A Problem</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											There was growing consciousness and activism on the contentious problem of landmines in the 1990s. Horrific tales and images from around the globe often indicated that civilians were the primary landmine victims in large amounts — and continued to be so years after the belligerent groups left the battlefield. Even today, it has not always been feasible to clear decades-old minefields. It's often risky, dangerous, and time-consuming. Other times, finding resources to help rehabilitate survivors has proved difficult. In the midst of a conflict, records are rarely kept on exact locations for any or all landmines. This makes de-mining efforts extremely challenging and risky. Moreover, landmines often make the land unusable until the mines are cleared. This means that individuals who rely on the neighboring area for their livelihoods may have to discover alternative ways of life.
										</p>
										<p>
											Once they have been planted, landmines will not leave until they have been removed. Landmines sown during the First World War still cause death and devastation in areas of Europe and North Africa. Landmines do not comply with peace or ceasefire agreements. The only way to avoid long-term harm is to completely stop landmine use and commit resources to clearing minefields and assisting mine survivors.
										</p>
										<p>
											Since anti-personnel mines are indiscriminate and remain on or in the ground long after conflicts have ended, the large bulk of casualties are civilians, not troops. Landmine Monitor revealed that civilians account for 70 to 85 percent of the deaths year after year. This is not only during a conflict — most countries in which casualties are reported are at peace.
										</p>
										<p>
											Children injured by landmines face months of recovery if they do not die and are treated in time. Many are killed on the spot because of blood loss, shock, or damage to internal organs. Every year, a growing child with a prosthetic limb will need to refit it. After their injury, some kids never return to school. For instance, many face social exclusion, as they are not considered fit for marriage. Like adult survivors, in their phase of recovery and reintegration they will experience huge practical, financial, cultural and psychological difficulties.
