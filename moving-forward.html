											<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
											<h3>What The International Community Must Do Now To Work Towards Resolution</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Landmines have an enormous effect on societies. Their impacts are all the more pervasive as they are not conflict-limited. They go on for decades. Thus societies are impacted not only in the immediate term, but for generations. Landmines are not just the source of an immediate crisis in a conflicting country, they are also a long-term hurdle to a community and its people's complete peace and post-conflict development. Thus, children who now live with landmines are impacted. But so will be their children, and the children of their children. The only way to address this scourge is to advance rapidly to fulfill the objective stated by the international community in the UN resolution on landmines and to eliminate landmines from the arsenals of the world once and for all.
										</p>
										<p>
											Given the scope of the issue, only one course of intervention seems feasible: to call for a worldwide ban on the production, use, stockpiling and transfer of AP landmines. The arguments in favor of this are anchored in three fundamental principles of international humanitarian law: that the use of weapons of a nature to cause unnecessary suffering or superfluous injury is unlawful; that indiscriminate weapons and the indiscriminate use of weapons are prohibited; and that weapons which violate the “dictates of public conscience” should be prohibited.
										</p>
										<p>
											The end of the landmine crisis, however, does not need to await a global, negotiated consensus. Governments and regional or sub-regional organizations can decide to resolve the crisis in their own regions and thus contribute to a international solution. The most effective and permanent national measures are laws, such as those passed by Belgium and under consideration in other nations, banning the manufacturing, storage, transfer and use of anti-personnel mines.
										</p>
										<p>
											<b style=" font-weight: 500;">Enhanced mine-clearance efforts:</b> The United Nations requested $75 million for mine clearance funding in 1995, but received only $20 million; compared to an estimated $33 billion needed to clear all currently emplaced mines. A massive and long-term international effort is needed if future generations are to be spared paying the price for today's landmine legacy.
										</p>
										<p>
											<b style=" font-weight: 500;">Increased assistance to mine victims:</b> Only a small proportion of mine victims currently have access to rehabilitation programs. Substantially expanded resources will be needed to provide victims with both emergency medical treatment and lifetime care, even if mine use were stopped immediately. National and international agencies can support these efforts through surgical and prosthetic projects of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the National Society, through direct bilateral assistance, and through the efforts of other humanitarian agencies.
										</p>
										<p>
											<b style=" font-weight: 500;">Prevention through mine-awareness programs:</b> The ICRC now runs mine awareness programs for civilian populations in five countries and many more are run by a variety of national agencies and humanitarian organizations. Such efforts must be expanded rapidly so that populations at risk from mines can better protect themselves.
