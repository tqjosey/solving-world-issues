<p>The Enlightenment was an intellectual and philosophical movement that dominated the world of ideas in Europe during the 18th century. Enlightenment thinkers in Britain, in France, and throughout Europe questioned traditional authority and embraced the notion that humanity could be improved through rational change. In fact, classical liberal principles originated in the Enlightenment, particularly with the writings of John Locke. He set out the case for a limited government, respectful of private property rights and tolerant of religious differences. The perspective presented in the source leans farther right and is most congruent with the political ideology of classical liberalism. The speaker’s emphasis on the classical liberal principles of self-interest and economic freedom suggests that they are passionately against government intervention and in favor of the free market. Advocates of free-market or laissez-faire economics generally view government interventions as harmful due to the law of unintended consequences, belief in government's inability to effectively manage economic concerns, and other considerations. The speaker’s contention that government involvement is a form of interference is mitigated by the admission that there is some need for government presence. This encroachment would be lessened, the speaker argues, if society were to adopt certain fundamental tenets of classical liberalism. Political economist and philosopher John Stuart Mill would agree with the speaker’s perspective, as he wrote about the benefits of laissez-faire political and economic systems in many of his works. In On Liberty, Mill concludes that free markets are preferable to those controlled by governments. He argues that economies function best when left to their own devices. Economists Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek also espouse the values reflected in the source and argue that limited government and economic freedom are necessary for political freedom. According to all of these theorists, self-interest is vital to the creation of a prosperous society in which individuals strive to better their own economic position in life. Conversely, proponents of leftist economic beliefs would recoil in disgust at the perspective presented in the source. Luminaries such as Karl Marx wrote about the risks of unfettered capitalism in The Communist Manifesto. Marx believed that the more capitalism creates wealth, the more it sows the seeds of its own destruction. Marx also condemned the free market as being anarchic, or ungoverned. He maintained that the way the market economy is coordinated—through the purchase and sale of private property dictated by the laws of supply and demand—blocks our ability to take control of our individual and collective destinies. In evaluating the source it is clear that the position that “Society achieves its finest expression through the self-interest and freedom of individuals” is demonstrably false and should not be embraced. What the speaker does not recognize is that an economy that is not restrained by government intervention and oversight can often result in negative political, economic, and social consequences.</p>
<p>Known as “The Father of Capitalism," no figure did more to extol the benefits of laissez-faire economic policy than the economist and Enlightenment philosopher Adam Smith. In Smith's view, the free market system works because it is guided by the "invisible hand" of self-interest. In the selfish pursuit of more profit, the business owner provides something of greater value to the market. Smith and his invisible hand have been used to argue that unfettered free markets—without safeguards like government regulations—are the only way to ensure economic prosperity. Smith's free-market ideas were embraced wholeheartedly in the United States. During the boom economy of the Roaring Twenties, Republican presidents held firm to a laissez-faire, do-nothing economic policy that allowed businesses to maximize profit. As a result, the Roaring Twenties was a decade of economic growth and widespread prosperity, driven by recovery from wartime devastation, a boom in construction, and the rapid growth of consumer goods. For many, the Roaring Twenties was an example of society achieving its finest expression through the self-interest and economic freedom of individuals—but then the Stock Market Crash of 1929 happened. Millions of shares ended up worthless, and as consumer confidence vanished in the wake of the stock market crash, the downturn in spending and investment led factories and other businesses to slow down production and begin firing their workers. Thus, the stock market crash signaled the beginning of the decade-long Great Depression that affected all Western industrialized countries. From 1929 to 1939, America's unfettered free-market economy failed to operate at a level that allowed most Americans to attain economic success. The Great Depression was undoubtedly caused by the ideas propagated by individuals such as Smith and the speaker in the source. In reality, unfettered laissez-faire capitalism did not help society achieve its finest expression and instead led to the longest, deepest, and most widespread depression of the 20th century. After the 1929 stock market crash, Republican president Herbert Hoover tried to temper his predecessor's laissez-faire stance, but it was too late. As the Depression wore on, Franklin D. Roosevelt was eventually elected president in 1932. He immediately embarked on an ambitious plan to get the country out of the Great Depression by embracing modern liberalism. His signature legislation, the New Deal, expanded the role of the federal government in the nation’s economy to address the challenges of the Great Depression. John Maynard Keynes was an economist whose economic theories greatly influenced and helped Franklin D. Roosevelt devise his plan to rescue the United States from the Great Depression. Keynes' basic idea was simple: to keep people fully employed, governments have to run deficits when the economy is slowing, as the private sector would not invest enough to keep production at the normal level and bring the economy out of recession. Keynes also called on governments during times of economic crisis to pick up the slack by increasing government spending. As the greatest realizer of Keynesian economics, Franklin D. Roosevelt used public works, farm subsidies, and other devices to restart the U.S. economy. The New Deal represented a 180-degree shift toward active intervention, big-government social programs, and economic stimulus measures. Government interference ultimately resolved the catastrophe caused by self-interest and unfettered capitalism, using the same principles that supporters of the free market claimed would be the downfall of society.</p>
<p>The collapse of Lehman Brothers, a global investment bank, in 2008 almost brought down the world’s financial system. It took huge taxpayer-financed bailouts to shore up the industry. The financial crisis happened because banks were able to create too much money, too quickly, and used it to push up house prices and speculate on financial markets. Every time a bank makes a loan, new money is created. In the run-up to the financial crisis, banks created huge sums of new money by making loans. Very little of the money that banks created between 2000–2007 went to businesses outside of the financial sector. Around one-third went to residential property, which pushed up house prices faster than wages. Another one-third went to the financial sector and the same financial markets that eventually imploded during the financial crisis. Lending large sums of money into the property market pushed up the price of houses along with the level of personal debt. Interest has to be paid on all the loans that banks make, and with the debt rising quicker than incomes, eventually, some people became unable to keep up with repayments. At this point, they stopped repaying their loans, and banks found themselves in danger of going bankrupt. This process, created by greed and free-market capitalism, caused the 2008 financial crisis. The banking sector of the U.S. came very close to collapse and had to be rescued by government intervention. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was a $700 billion government bailout designed to keep the nation's banks operating during the 2008 financial crisis. TARP's initial purpose was to bail out banks; by the time the program was completed, however, it had been used in many areas. President George W. Bush agreed to use TARP funds to bail out the Big Three auto companies. Auto executives warned that General Motors and Chrysler faced bankruptcy and the loss of one million jobs. While TARP ended the 2008 financial crisis by bailing out large banks, the Great Recession that followed led to some of the highest recorded rates of unemployment and home foreclosures in the U.S. since the Great Depression. President Barack Obama didn't use the remaining money allocated for TARP because he didn't want to bail out any more businesses. Instead, he asked Congress for an economic stimulus package. Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which included tax cuts, stimulus checks, and public works spending. It put billions directly into the pockets of consumers and small businesses, which was enough to end the Great Recession by 2009. In doing so, Obama prevented untold hardship on the American people and a worldwide economic meltdown. Indeed, as bad as the Great Recession was, it would have been worse without government interference. The actions taken by the United States government were exactly the opposite of those advocated by the speaker in the source. The ideology of unfettered self-interest and freedom of individuals caused the financial crisis, and people were starting to catch on—following the 2008 financial crisis, there was a worldwide resurgence of interest in Keynesian economics among prominent economists and policymakers. This included discussions and implementation of economic policies following the recommendations made by John Maynard Keynes in response to the Great Depression.</p>
<p>The leader of the first socialist government in North America, Tommy Douglas brought massive change to the province of Saskatchewan and led the way for many social reforms in the rest of Canada. As a result, the Canadian government is now expected to address economic and social issues such as poverty, health care, education, and the climate using government intervention whilst also emphasizing the rights and autonomy of the individual—thus improving every citizen's quality of life. Tommy Douglas had a new vision for the role of government; he believed that it had the responsibility to better the lives of ordinary people. According to Tommy Douglas, only government intervention could alleviate the suffering he saw around him. Tommy Douglas saw his universal health care program, commonly known as Medicare, enacted in Saskatchewan in 1962 and later by the federal government in 1966. The speaker in the source would be in staunch opposition to these actions, but to suggest that Canadian health care is inferior to the American system—a system ruined by self-interest and profit motive—is simply untrue. There’s no question that American health care, a mixture of private insurance and public programs, is a mess. In 2007–2008, health-insurance premiums more than doubled, leaving firms like General Motors on the brink of bankruptcy. Expensive health care has also hit workers in the pocketbook, causing median family income to fall. The number of uninsured Americans has risen, and even insured Americans seem dissatisfied. So it’s not surprising that some Americans think that solving the nation’s health care woes may require adopting a Canadian-style single-payer system, in which the government finances and provides the care. Canadians not only spend less on health care; our health outcomes are better, too—life expectancy is longer, infant mortality lower, etc. These benefits, however, would not have been possible without the interference of the government in our lives, something that the speaker wants to reduce.</p>
<p>The position that “Society achieves its finest expression through the self-interest and freedom of individuals” is verifiably false and should not be embraced. When the ideology promoted by the speaker first emerged, it was revolutionary. Classical liberalism developed in the early 19th century, building on ideas from the previous century as a response to the Industrial Revolution in Europe and the United States. Classical liberalism transformed the life of man, and tens of millions who would have perished in the inefficient economy of the old world were able to survive. This laissez-faire philosophy became the bedrock creed of countless Americans of all classes. Freedom, according to classical liberals, was maximized when the government took a hands-off attitude toward the economy. Over time, however, it has been proven that government interference in the economy is not only useful but oftentimes necessary. The ideas of classical liberalism remained essentially unchallenged until a series of depressions, thought to be impossible according to the tenets of classical liberalism, led to economic hardship from which citizens demanded relief. The two greatest economic catastrophes in the U.S. of the last 100 years—the Great Depression and the 2008 financial crisis—are both examples of the need for government intervention in the economy. Both catastrophes were laid at the feet of laissez-faire capitalism, a system that is inherently flawed and prone to failure. To correct for the market failure associated with the Great Depression, Roosevelt came up with the New Deal. In short, the prescription was a massive increase in the scope and scale of the government’s reach and involvement in the economy. This type of response has also followed the Great Recession, ushering in a plethora of government regulations, particularly those that affect banks and financial institutions. Additionally, Tommy Douglas's introduction of universal health care legislation serves as an example of how government interference in our lives has greatly benefited society. Universal health care lowers health care costs for an economy, eliminates the administrative costs of dealing with different private health insurers, and forces hospitals and doctors to provide the same standard of service at a low cost. After evaluating the presented case studies, it is clear that society achieves its finest expression not through self-interest and freedom of individuals, but through the embracing of modern liberal principles and direct government intervention in the economy.</p>
