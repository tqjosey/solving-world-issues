<p>The impact of coveting what others have can often lead to life's hazardous and destructive routes: paths where evil and wrath can unleash; paths that cannot be changed or backtracked. In the play, Macbeth by William Shakespeare, the vaulting ambition of Macbeth to become King of Scotland causes him to lose his once honorable self as he descends into the depths of evil in search of his awakened desire. In the novel, Lord of the Flies by William Golding, both Jack and Ralph struggle immensely, albeit for different reasons, to gain the power they so strongly desire. Their struggle takes them on a journey through moral compromises and primitive savagery. Coveting the positions of others, particularly those of authority, can generate vaulting aspirations that cause wickedness, and wild, primal human instincts to emerge. These urges often take over a once normal person and destroy not just their previously good nature, but their entire lives.</p>
<p>In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Macbeth is introduced as a conquering hero, whose notoriety on the battlefield earns him great honor from the king. In truth, while Macbeth is a brave soldier and a powerful man, he is not a virtuous one. Macbeth's private ambitions are made clear to the audience through his asides and soliloquies. These often conflict with the opinion others have of him, which he describes as "golden." Macbeth is led to wicked thoughts by the prophecies of the three witches, especially after their prophecy that he will be made thane of Cawdor comes true. As a result, Macbeth begins to covet the throne of King Duncan as he becomes consumed by his vaulting ambition to become King of Scotland. He is easily tempted into murder to fulfill his ambitions to the throne, and once he commits his first crime and is crowned King of Scotland, he embarks on further atrocities with increasing ease. Incidentally, Lady Macbeth plays an important role in spurring Macbeth's ambition. Lady Macbeth is already plotting the murder of Duncan when readers first encounter her, and she is stronger, more ruthless, and more ambitious than her husband. She seems to be fully aware of this and knows that she will have to push Macbeth into committing murder. Lady Macbeth manipulates her husband with remarkable efficacy, overriding all of his reservations; when Macbeth hesitates to murder, she repeatedly questions his manhood until he feels that he must commit murder to prove himself. Afterward, however, she enters a slow descent into madness—just as she is affected more intensely by ambition than Macbeth before the crime, so does guilt plague her more strongly afterward. She was driven to sleepwalking through the castle by the end of the play, desperately trying to wash away an invisible bloodstain. Once the feeling of guilt sinks in, the sensitivity of Lady Macbeth becomes a weakness and she is unable to cope. She (apparently) kills herself, indicating her total inability to deal with the negative impacts of coveting King Duncan's throne. As Macbeth commits more and more heinous acts (i.e., the murders of Duncan, Lady Macduff, and Banquo), his primitive instincts of savagery arise and he too loses sight of who he once was: a venerable and noble kinsman. Eventually, what he covets from Duncan—to take his place as king—becomes his demise. A battle culminates in Macduff's confrontation with Macbeth, and Macduff kills and beheads him, thus fulfilling the remaining prophecy.</p>
<p>In Golding's novel Lord of the Flies, Jack covets Ralph's assumed leadership. From the outset of the novel, Jack desires authority above all else. Jack believes he should be the leader because he has always been the leader in the past, even though that leadership was based on something completely unrelated to his ability to govern: a nice singing voice. Jack is upset when he loses the election to Ralph and continuously pushes the limits of his subordinate position in the group. In Chapter 8, Jack accuses Ralph of belittling the hunters. He claims Ralph is like Piggy, and that he is not a proper chief. Jack calls for a vote to remove Ralph and make himself leader, however, no one votes for Jack, and Jack storms off humiliated and crying. He vows to form a new group and says that anyone can join him when he hunts. Ralph discovers after the fire that all the biguns, except for Piggy and Samneric, have vanished—most of them leaving to join Jack's tribe. Publicly, the biguns are not prepared to oppose Ralph, but privately they choose Jack and savagery. Jack's longing to become chief instills a sense of solidarity and security among the children who join Jack's tribe. The boys view him as an experienced, fearless hunter who can take care of them and protect them from the beast. Early on, Jack retains the sense of moral propriety and behavior that society instilled in him. However, now that his imperious desire has come to fruition, Jack loses this portion of himself, and his primitive instincts of savagery begin to fully emerge. Jack goes from being a proper schoolboy who led the choir to a savage murderer. He leads the brutal slaughter of a pig—and then Simon. When Jack picks up a spear and then walks out on Ralph's pitiful attempt to impose order, he is not a boy anymore: he is a savage. In parallel, Ralph covets Jack's ability to be a carefree leader. Ralph admits that he wants to join Jack and the others in living a more easygoing lifestyle, but he cannot. Ralph believes in the group's good and the promise of rescue, and therefore cannot take part in savagery. Despite that, even Ralph starts to lose sight of why the fire is so essential. Ralph's yearning to possess the hunter's youthful insouciance contributes to his gradual mental and moral deterioration throughout the novel. Ralph's mental workings and moral compass are subject to the same decay as his clothing; both are frayed by the rigors of primitive life. Ralph has become worn down by the hardships and fears of his situation and is slowly infected by the savagery of the other boys. Ralph's thinking inevitably becomes confused and he loses focus, undermining his capacity to be a powerful and compelling leader. The manner of living Ralph covets and the island's increasing hostilities engenders a fear that he has destroyed his innocence and is transforming into a lawless savage. For Ralph, nothing can ever be as it was before coming to the island of the Lord of the Flies.</p>
<p>In conclusion, both Macbeth and Lord of the Flies develop the idea that coveting the positions of others, especially those of power, can produce vaulting ambitions that evoke vileness, and give rise to vicious, primal human instincts—urges that often consume a once normal person and destroy not only their former good nature, but their whole lives as well. In Macbeth, an honorable Scottish general self-destructs, leaving unthinkable carnage in his wake as he pursues the position of power King Duncan possesses. In Lord of the Flies, scholarly young schoolboys drawn into a rivalry for the authority of leadership descend into the immoral, basic primal nature of mankind in their pursuit. The characters of Macbeth and Jack were so easily swayed to abandon their moral senses when fueled by their deep desires and ambition to possess the greatness that is projected onto those in positions of great power.</p>
