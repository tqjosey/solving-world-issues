										<p>
										As Cambodians use land in new areas in search of economic opportunities, they find their lives threatened by dangerous landmines and unexploded ordnance that have yet to be removed. Below is video on how the HALO Trust’s work in Cambodia provides new farming opportunities and protects families.

											<h2>Landmines In Cambodia</h2>
											<h3>A Lethal Legacy From The War</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Landmines were set in Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge's ousting in 1979 and persisted until its downfall in 1998. Tens of thousands of local citizens were forcibly conscripted to construct a barrier minefield along the full 750 kilometer long Cambodia-Thai border to prevent the return of the Khmer Rouge. Furthermore, State of Cambodia forces had set additional landmines to protect cities, villages and supply routes from assault by warring factions.
										</p>
										<p>
											Although 50 percent of Cambodia's minefields have now been cleared, Cambodia is still one of the world's most affected nations with over 64,000 deaths reported since 1979 and over 25,000 amputees — the highest ratio per capita in the world. More than 80 percent of the total population reside in rural regions, in agricultural-dependent communities. Northwest Cambodia has seen a 35 percent increase in population since the end of hostilities and this rapid population growth has meant that these areas represent a very high relative percentage of the total national mine accidents.
										</p>
										<p>
											Despite a decrease in death figures over recent years, Cambodia's mine and explosive issue remains a significant impediment to the country's social and economic growth. The landmine threat is now largely concentrated in just 21 border districts in the rural northwest of Cambodia. It prevents development by hindering access to land, water supplies, highways, and health facilities, and imposes economic and mental distress on households who need to care for a landmine victim.
										</p>
										<p>
											The HALO Trust was the first organisation to react to the landmine issue in Cambodia in 1991. They employ and train female and male de-miners from the mine-affected districts so that contaminated communities are part of the clearance process as well as ensuring that donor funding, in the form of wages, reaches some of Cambodia's most marginalized communities. In addition to their clearance work, study groups from CMAC and HALO have identified the nature and extent of landmine contamination in Cambodia. They frequently obtain data to update the national IMSMA database, which offers precise data to the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority (CMAA) to handle the landmine clearance process and restore land to safe use as efficiently as possible.
